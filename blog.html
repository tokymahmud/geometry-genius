      <h1 class="text-center fw-bold text-decoration-underline">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
      <p class="fs-3 fw-normal">Dom means document object model. It is a programming interface for web documents.
<br>
Basically, the DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. By this way, programming languages can interact with the page which we can say a dynamic page.DOm is one kind of standard for add, delete, validate, manipulate html. We can make the static html boring page into interactive , responsive page.So that way we can do various type of work done.

      </p>
    <h1 class="text-center fw-bold text-decoration-underline">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
    <p class="fs-3 fw-normal"> We can select HTML elements by using dom. we can call each and every elemnt one time or as many time we want.
        we can call them by their id, tagname, class etc. <br>
    the DOM methods which we will use to call HTML elements are:
    <ul class="fs-3 fw-normal">
        <li>getElementsByTagName()
        </li>
        <li>getElementsByClassName()
        </li>
        <li>getElementById()
        </li>
        <li>querySelector()
        </li>
        <li>querySelectorAll()
        </li> 

    </ul>
 </p>
    <h1 class="text-center fw-bold text-decoration-underline">What is event bubble? </h1>
    <p class="fs-3 fw-normal">Event bubble is a concept in DOM. It happens when a element recieves an event. it goes upward through finding the root. Like if we click a button and it was in a span. it wil bubble up to span than it will find its root upwards. It will do it because it is a child of span. Also the span could be clid of something else. and that is how it work. And this process is called event bubbling.

    </p>
    <h1 class="text-center fw-bold text-decoration-underline">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
    <p class="fs-3 fw-normal">
it is a function which is parsed into another function as an argument. This  is called a callback function.By this it one call call another function. <br>
We know that many actions and function are not asyncronus. Also the dont stop untill they reach the end of a function. By this it will run the code while otheer are functioning in the backwards.Js runs in sequential in top-down order.But, there are many cases whern code runs after something happens which must not be sequantially.We know that by the name of asynchronous programming. In these type of case, callback function make sure that  before completing a task  the function is not going to run. Either, it will run right after the task has completed.Also, It helps us develop asynchronous js code.By this Callback function we get lesser error.
